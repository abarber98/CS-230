## Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is a company creating a game based on the 1980s television game Win, Lose or Draw. They are currently operating on Android and would like to expand and support the game on other platforms. 

## What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I took a lot more time than I usually would. I enjoyed learning more about what Linux offered, as I was not too familiar with Linux before this course. This knowledge helped me plan out the routes I would take to meet The Gaming Room's requirements and helped to establish a better understanding of how I could handle similar projects using Linux.

## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The project's direction was much more structured and paced out in a way that made developing easier. There were clear goals for each iteration and having them broken down into chunks helped me to pace myself and develop a larger project without being overwhelmed. 

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The recommendations. I think I could benefit a lot from familiarizing myself with more of the features available on Linux. This would allow me to expand on my findings better and give recommendations that would impact The Gaming Room much more and promote a better roll-out of Draw It or Lose it. 

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I took the requirements of the program and researched the ways that I could make them happen in the most efficient way. This is extremely important as the client knows what they would like the end result to be, and it is your job as a developer to communicate with your client and speak on how you intend to meet or exceed their requirements. This is also a time where you can give insight to the client and recommend things that they may have overlooked or explain the best ways to execute their goals.  

## How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I took a step back in many areas and tried to familiarize myself with aspects that I was not as knowledgeable about. This allowed me to learn more about the solutions that could be implemented to have the best results for The Gaming Room. This saved me some time as I was able to plan out how I would design the software. I think doing this is a great approach and proper planning and research is integral to software development.
